# controllercheck.org

controllercheck.org is a lightweight, open-source web tool for testing and calibrating game controllers directly in the browser.

The project is optimized for the PlayStation 5 controller (DualSense standard) but also works with many other HID and XInput gamepads.

**This project is still in an early stage of development and is actively evolving.**
